# Secure Spreadsheet

ðŸ”¥ Secure your data exports - encrypt and password protect sensitive XLSX files

The [Office Open XML format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_Open_XML) provides a standard for encryption and password protection

Works with Excel, Numbers, and LibreOffice Calc

[![Build Status](https://github.com/nick322/secure-spreadsheet/workflows/tests/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/nick322/secure-spreadsheet/actions)

## Installation

To install the package:

Run ``composer require nick322/secure-spreadsheet`` to add the package to your project.

Or run ``composer global require nick322/secure-spreadsheet`` to add the package to your system.

This will automatically install the package to your vendor folder.

## Use

In cli

```bash
secure-spreadsheet run --password=1 --input=/Users/nick/Encryptor/Book1.xlsx --output=/Users/nick/Encryptor/bb.xlsx

```

In php

```php
require "vendor/autoload.php";

use Nick\SecureSpreadsheet\Encrypt;

$test = new Encrypt();
$test->input('Book1.xlsx')
    ->password('111')
    ->output('bb.xlsx');
```


If you want to only use memory/variable output and input, and no file interaction
```php
$test = new Encrypt($nofile = true);
$output = $test->input($binaryData)
    ->password('111')
    ->output();
```
