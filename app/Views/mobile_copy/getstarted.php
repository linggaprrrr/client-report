We are happy and grateful that you made the decision to work with us and our dedicated team. We have over 40 team members working hard to make sure your experience is a great one.
                </p>
                <p>Below is a list of a few of the things we need you to do to get the process started.</p>
                <p class="text-justify">Before you do any purchase of inventory or brand approvals we <b>HIGHLY</b> recommend watching this video about the process and expectations for this business. We are <b>NOT</b> a get rich quick scheme nor are we here to promise the unrealistic. You will experience good profitable months and other months may not be. This is the nature of business especially with Amazon. Building an Amazon FBA store takes time and patience. </p>

                        <p>Make sure to connect with your Customer Service team thru Facebook messenger.

                        <p>We need you to set up your $150/month recurring payment. This payment will begin 30 days after you set up the payment. Please note this step needs to be done PRIOR to purchasing inventory. (<a href="https://square.link/u/KYEuq1Hy" target="_blank">https://square.link/u/KYEuq1Hy</a>)</p>

                        <p>It's time to purchase inventory! Please remember to spread your merchandise budget out over the first 4-6 months. DO NOT spend it all at once. Amazon rewards activity and consistency in your store. They first need to trust you, and they need to see consistent creation or replenishment of inventory in your store. Placing one order and sitting and waiting until that order completely sells out is not advisable. Your store will not perform well.
